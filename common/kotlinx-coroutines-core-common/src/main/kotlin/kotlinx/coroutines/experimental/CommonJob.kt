/**
 * A background job. Conceptually, a job is a cancellable thing with a simple life-cycle that
 * culminates in its completion. Jobs can be arranged into parent-child hierarchies where cancellation
 * or completion of parent immediately cancels all its children.
 *
 * The most basic instances of [Job] are created with [launch] coroutine builder or with a
 * `Job()` factory function.  Other coroutine builders and primitives like
 * [Deferred] also implement [Job] interface.
 *
 * A job has the following states:
 *
 * | **State**                               | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCancelled] |
 * | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
 * | _New_ (optional initial state)          | `false`    | `false`       | `false`       |
 * | _Active_ (default initial state)        | `true`     | `false`       | `false`       |
 * | _Completing_ (optional transient state) | `true`     | `false`       | `false`       |
 * | _Cancelling_ (optional transient state) | `false`    | `false`       | `true`        |
 * | _Cancelled_ (final state)               | `false`    | `true`        | `true`        |
 * | _Completed_ (final state)               | `false`    | `true`        | `false`       |
 *
 * Usually, a job is created in _active_ state (it is created and started). However, coroutine builders
 * that provide an optional `start` parameter create a coroutine in _new_ state when this parameter is set to
 * [CoroutineStart.LAZY]. Such a job can be made _active_ by invoking [start] or [join].
 *
 * A job can be _cancelled_ at any time with [cancel] function that forces it to transition to
 * _cancelling_ state immediately. Job that is not backed by a coroutine and does not have
 * [children][attachChild] becomes _cancelled_ on [cancel] immediately.
 * Otherwise, job becomes _cancelled_  when it finishes executing its code and
 * when all its children [complete][isCompleted].
 *
 * ```
 *                                                      wait children
 *    +-----+       start      +--------+   complete   +-------------+  finish  +-----------+
 *    | New | ---------------> | Active | -----------> | Completing  | -------> | Completed |
 *    +-----+                  +--------+              +-------------+          +-----------+
 *       |                         |                         |
 *       | cancel                  | cancel                  | cancel
 *       V                         V                         |
 *  +-----------+   finish   +------------+                  |
 *  | Cancelled | <--------- | Cancelling | <----------------+
 *  |(completed)|            +------------+
 *  +-----------+
 * ```
 *
 * A job in the [coroutineContext][CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] represents the coroutine itself.
 * A job is active while the coroutine is working and job's cancellation aborts the coroutine when
 * the coroutine is suspended on a _cancellable_ suspension point by throwing [CancellationException].
 *
 * A job can have a _parent_ job. A job with a parent is cancelled when its parent is cancelled or completes exceptionally.
 * Parent job waits for all its [children][attachChild] to complete in _completing_ or _cancelling_ state.
 * _Completing_ state is purely internal to the job. For an outside observer a _completing_ job is still active,
 * while internally it is waiting for its children.
 *
 * All functions on this interface and on all interfaces derived from it are **thread-safe** and can
 * be safely invoked from concurrent coroutines without external synchronization.
